<!-- # Welcome to the Front-End Developer Test!

This practical test is designed to evaluate your ability to build a functional React.js application using TypeScript. Through this task, we aim to understand your technical skills, approach to problem-solving, and familiarity with front-end development tools and practices. -->

<!-- ## Your Task: Build a Product Catalog Application
You will create a simple **Product Catalog** application where users can browse products, add items to shopping cart, filter items by category and sort items by price. This project will showcase your ability to:
- Initialize a React project and set up a development environment.
- Create reusable components with props and define types for them using TypeScript.
- Manage state effectively using React's useState and Context API.
- Integrate with APIs to fetch data dynamically.
- Apply basic CSS for styling the application. -->
- Write basic unit tests for React components.
<!-- - Use Git for version control. -->

## What We Expect
1. **Core Features**:
    <!-- - A **Home Page** displaying a list of products with their details (e.g., image, name, price, category).  -->
    <!-- - A **Shopping Cart Page** listing products added to the "Shopping Cart" -->
    <!-- - A **Filter and Sort Feature** allowing users to filter products by category and to sort by price. -->
    <!-- - **Add to Cart** and **Remove from Cart** functionality for each product. -->
    <!-- - **Total Price** calculation for all products in the cart. -->
    <!-- - **Clear Cart** button to remove all products from the cart. -->
2. **Technical Implementation**:
    <!-- - Fetch product data from a public mock API (https://fakestoreapi.com/).  -->
    <!-- - Use `useState` for local state and Context API for managing the "Shopping Cart" list.  -->
    <!-- - Ensure components are reusable and well-structured with appropriate TypeScript types. Example of reusable components: Button, Table, Card. -->
    <!-- - Implement base layout with header(with navigation), footer, and main content area. It will serve as a template for the Home and Cart pages. -->
    <!-- - Implement basic routing using React Router for navigation between pages. -->
    <!-- - Use TypeScript for static typing and defining interfaces. -->
3. **Styling**:
    <!-- - Create a user-friendly interface with basic CSS styling (optional: use a CSS framework like TailwindCSS or Styled-Components). -->
4. **Testing**:
    - Write at least one unit test using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or Jest.
5. **Version Control**:
    <!-- - Use Git to manage your code, with a clear and meaningful commit history (tip: use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) ). -->

### Bonus Points
The bonus points are **optional** features that you can implement to enhance the application and showcase your skills. You can choose one or more of the following:
<!-- - **Responsive Design**: Make the application responsive for different screen sizes(mobile size it's enough). (tip: use media queries). -->
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for API requests and user interactions. (tip: show error messages to users).
- **Loading State**: Add loading indicators or skeleton screens to improve the user experience. (tip: use loading state for API requests).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is accessible and follows best practices for web accessibility. (tip: use semantic HTML elements).
- **Additional Features**: Add any additional features or enhancements you think would improve the application. (tip: product details modal/page, search functionality).
- **Documentation**: Provide a README with clear instructions on how to run the application and a brief description of your approach and any important decisions made.
- **Creativity**: Feel free to add your own creative touch or features to the application.

### Super Bonus Points
If you want to go the extra mile, you can also:
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
- **Testing**: Write additional unit tests to ensure the application works as expected.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for the product list. (tip: use query parameters for pagination).
- **Animations**: Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience. (tip: use CSS transitions).
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the application for performance (e.g., lazy loading, code splitting).

## Tools
<!-- - **React.js**: Use React.js to build the application. -->
<!-- - **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for static typing and defining interfaces. -->
<!-- - **API**: Use `fetch` to fetch product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). -->
<!-- - **React Router**: Use React Router for navigation between pages. -->
<!-- - **React Context**: Use React Context API for managing global state (e.g., shopping cart). -->

> **TIP**: To write clean, maintainable code following best practices and naming conventions, take a look at the [Clean Code JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) and [TypeScript Style Guide](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/styleguide).
